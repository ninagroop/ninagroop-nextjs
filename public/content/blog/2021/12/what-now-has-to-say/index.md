Some mornings I wake up and wish for certainty. I want life to make me promises, and instead life says, “Trust me.” I want life to be about knowing, but it insists on being about living. It’s about Now. I am continually learning to welcome the moment and let it speak. You may not be where you want to be or where you expected to be or where others expect you to be, and that is okay. Breathe. Where you are is exactly right, because Now has something to say. Now has its own light to shed and its own shadow to cast. It’s all for you. One step at a time. One breath at a time. This is your path. Trust it. Embody your life and you will live into what you long to know.
