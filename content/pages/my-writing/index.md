title: My Writing
---
When I was in fourth grade, my older brother, a recent college grad, gave me a copy of The
Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe and told me that the kids in college who could read fast did
well. This lit a fire in me, and I began devouring books. Yet I never once dreamed of writing
books myself; I would have said I hated writing. Years later, a brilliant college professor helped
me see writing in a new way, and the gift he named in me redirected my path.
I’ve been a writer and editor for over thirty years, helping others tell their stories while
continuing to shape my own. I currently work with nonprofits in their fundraising and
development efforts — writing grants, donor appeals, and communication pieces that build
connection and inspire action. But I’m also a poet, author, and Moth storyteller; my young self
would be quite surprised by how her story is turning out.

**_Genesis_**

_Open the door_ <br/>
_What stands between you and what will be_ <br/>
_is nothing more than all you do not know_

_Turn the handle_ </br>
_Did you expect the door to open from the other side —_ </br>
_to be invited — again — into this tomorrow?_

_No_ </br>
_If you are standing there,_</br>
_you have been invited_

_Cross the threshold_</br>
_Let your eyes adjust_</br>
_Have you ever gasped at the sight of the rising moon_</br>
_or the rush of the incoming tide?_</br>

_This will be like that_

_Look_</br>
_The moon is breaking your horizon_</br>
_Your feet are sinking in the wet sand_</br>
