title: My Writing
---
When I was in fourth grade, my older brother, a recent college grad, gave me a copy of The
Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe and told me that the kids in college who could read fast did
well. This lit a fire in me, and I began devouring books. Yet I never once dreamed of writing
books myself; I would have said I hated writing. Years later, a brilliant college professor helped
me see writing in a new way, and the gift he named in me redirected my path.
I’ve been a writer and editor for over thirty years, helping others tell their stories while
continuing to shape my own. I currently work with nonprofits in their fundraising and
development efforts — writing grants, donor appeals, and communication pieces that build
connection and inspire action. But I’m also a poet, author, and Moth storyteller; my young self
would be quite surprised by how her story is turning out.
