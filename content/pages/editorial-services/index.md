**Say what you mean — and say it well.**

I work with authors, thought leaders, and changemakers to shape their ideas into compelling,
polished books, websites, articles, and other communication pieces (strategic plans,
PowerPoint presentations, social media posts, etc.). Whether you're just beginning or putting
the final touches on a project, I offer support that meets you where you are.

I specialize in nonfiction — especially business, psychology and wellness, and spiritual topics —
and bring a calm, collaborative approach to every project.

## **Services I Offer**
- **Developmental Editing** – Big-picture feedback on structure, voice, clarity, and flow
- **Manuscript Evaluation** – A comprehensive review with actionable insights to guide your
revisions
- **Copy Editing** – Sentence-level refinement for grammar, consistency, tone, and style
- **Proofreading** – A final polish to catch errors after layout
- **Publishing Consultation** – Guidance on the self-publishing process

## **What It's Like to Work with Me**

Editing is a conversation, one that respects your voice and your vision. My role is to help you
say exactly what you mean, and to bring out the heart of what you’re trying to communicate. I
offer thoughtful, honest feedback and work at a pace that honors your timeline and process.
The goal is always to help you bring clarity and impact to the page.
