title: Grant Writing
---
**Clear. Strategic. Rooted in what matters.**

I work with nonprofits to turn meaningful work into compelling, fundable stories. With years of
experience in development, communications, and relationship-building, I bring a strategic,
collaborative approach to every proposal. From general operating support to project funding
and long-term grant strategy, I’ll help you clarify your goals, align your language with funder
priorities, and write proposals that reflect the heart of your mission.

## **What I Offer**
- **Proposal Writing** – Persuasive proposals tailored appropriately for foundations,
corporations, and/or government agencies
- **Grant Research** – Identifying potential funding opportunities that align with your
mission and capacity
- **Reporting** – Well-crafted reports that communicate results and help foster long-term
relationships
- **Appeals & Communications** – Donor-focused letters and messaging to support annual
giving and campaigns
- **Strategy & Consultation** – Support with calendars, systems, and messaging to
strengthen your grants program

## **How I Work**
Grant writing is part art, part strategy, and part relationship. I take the time to understand your
organization, listen for what makes your work unique, and translate that into language that
resonates with funders.
My approach is collaborative, detail-oriented, and respectful of your time and voice. Whether
you’re just starting to build a grants program or seeking support to strengthen your existing
efforts, I can meet you where you are.

us understand each funder’s priorities, and offered strategic suggestions for our applications,
annual appeal, website, newsletter, and overall communications. She is thoughtful, patient, and
a pleasure to work with.” — Elizabeth Harris, nonprofit executive_**
